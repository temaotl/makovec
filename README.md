# Makovec

Makovec is a simple [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com)-based web application to manage devices not using 802.1X to connect to local area network (LAN) in CESNET's Telehouse offices.

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/JanOppolzer/makovec/workflows/Laravel/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JanOppolzer/makovec/actions)

## Requirements

This application is written in Laravel 10 and uses PHP version at least 8.1.

Authentication is managed by locally running Shibboleth Service Provider, so Apache web server is highly recommended as there is an official Shibboleth module for Apache.

- PHP 8.1
- MariaDB 10
- Shibboleth SP 3
- Apache 2.4

The above mentioned requirements can easily be met by using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish). For those running older Ubuntu or Debian, [Ondřej Surý's PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php/) might be very appreciated.

### Setup

In order for the Envoy script to be really useful and do what it is designed for, you must setup Apache, PHP, MariaDB and Shibboleth SP at the destination host first.

(To prepare a server for Makovec, I am using an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) playbook that is currently not publicly available due to being part of our larger and internal mechanism, but I am willing to share it and most probably will do that in the future.)

#### Apache

Install Apache using `apt`.

```bash
apt install apache2
```

Then get a TLS certificate. If you would like to avoid paying to a Certificate Authority, use [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org) to get a certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) for free. Then configure Apache securely according to [Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=apache) using the following stub.

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName      server.example.org
    Redirect        permanent / https://server.example.org
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost _default_:443>
    ServerName      server.example.org
    DocumentRoot    /home/web/makovec/current/public/

    # TLS settings

    <Directory /home/web/makovec/current/public>
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

    <Location />
        AuthType shibboleth
        ShibRequestSetting requireSession 0
        <RequireAll>
            Require shibboleth
        </RequireAll>
    </Location>

    <Location /Shibboleth.sso>
        SetHandler shib
    </Location>
</VirtualHost>
```

It is also highly recommended to allow `web` user (the user defined in `envoy` file in the `TARGET_USER` variable, i.e. the one under which Makovec application is saved in `/home` directory) to reload and restart PHP-FPM. It helps with minimizing outage during deployment of a new version. Edit `/etc/sudoers.d/web` accordingly:

```text
web ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/bin/systemctl reload php8.1-fpm,/bin/systemctl restart php8.1-fpm
```

#### PHP

PHP 8.1 is present as an official package in recommended Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).

```bash
apt install php-fpm
```

Then follow information in your terminal.

```bash
a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif
a2enconf php8.1-fpm
systemctl restart apache2
```

(In case you still run on older Ubuntu version or Debian distribution with not so current PHP version, you might find [Ondřej Surý's repository](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php) highly useful.)

#### Shibboleth SP

Install and configure Shibboleth SP.

```bash
apt install libapache2-mod-shib
```

There is [documentation](https://www.eduid.cz/cs/tech/sp/shibboleth) (in Czech language, though) available at [eduID.cz](https://www.eduid.cz/cs/tech/sp/shibboleth) federation web page.

```xml
<ApplicationDefaults entityID="https://server.example.org/shibboleth"
    REMOTE_USER="uniqueId"
    sessionHook="/Shibboleth.sso/AttrChecker"
    cipherSuites="DEFAULT:!EXP:!LOW:!aNULL:!eNULL:!DES:!IDEA:!SEED:!RC4:!3DES:!kRSA:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!TLSv1:!TLSv1.1">

    <Sessions lifetime="28800" timeout="3600" relayState="ss:mem"
        checkAddress="false" handlerSSL="true" cookieProps="https"
        redirectLimit="exact">

        <!-- Attribute Checker -->
        <Handler type="AttributeChecker" Location="/AttrChecker" template="attrChecker.html"
            attributes="uniqueId mail cn" flushSession="true"/>

    </Sessions>

    <!-- Extract information from SAML metadata -->
    <AttributeExtractor type="Metadata" DisplayName="displayName"
        InformationURL="informationURL" OrganizationURL="organizationURL">
        <ContactPerson id="Technical-Contact" contactType="technical" formatter="$EmailAddress"/>
    </AttributeExtractor>

</ApplicationDefaults>
```

Then tweak `attrChecker.html`, `localLogout.html` and `metadataError.html` so users are informed properly when any issue occurs. If you need any help, check GÉANT's documentation regarding [attribute checking](https://wiki.geant.org/display/eduGAIN/How+to+configure+Shibboleth+SP+attribute+checker).

## Installation

The easiest way to install Makovec is to use Laravel [Envoy](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/envoy) script that is included in this repository.

Laravel Envoy is currently available only for _macOS_ and _Linux_ operating systems. However, on Windows you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Of course, you can also use a virtualized Linux system inside, for example, a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) machine.

The destination host should be running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) with PHP 8.1. If that is not the case, take care and tweak PHP-FPM service in `Envoy.blade.php` and in Apache configuration accordingly.

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanOppolzer/makovec
```

Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Prepare a _configuration file_ for your deployment using `envoy.example` template.

```bash
cp envoy.example envoy
```

Tweaking `envoy` file to your needs should be easy as all the variables within the file are self explanatory. Then just run the _deploy_ task.

```bash
./vendor/bin/envoy run deploy
```

### Tasks

There are two tasks available — `deploy` and `cleanup`.

#### deploy

The `deploy` task simply deploys the current version available at the repository into timestamped directory and makes a symbolic link `current`. This helps you with rolling back to the previous version if you need to. Just `ssh` into your web server and create a symbolic link to any previous version still available.

```bash
./vendor/bin/envoy run deploy
```

#### cleanup

The `cleanup` task helps you keeping your destination directory clean by leaving only three latest versions (i.e. timestamped directories) available and deletes all the older versions.

```bash
./vendor/bin/envoy run cleanup
```

### Why no stories?

_Laravel Envoy_ allows to use "stories" to help with grouping a set of tasks. Eventually, it makes the whole script much more readable as well as reusable.

There is one downside with stories, though. If your SSH agent requests confirming every use of your key (a highly recommended best practice!), you must confirm the key usage for every single Envoy story. I find it **very** annoying so therefore I have decided not to use stories after all.

## Local Development

To run this application locally for development, the easiest way is via Laravel Sail.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanOppolzer/makovec
cd makovec
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```
